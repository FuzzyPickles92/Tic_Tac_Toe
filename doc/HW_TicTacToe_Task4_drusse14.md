## *Lessons Learned*
1. This task taught me alot about incrementing counters because the method I created,  `DisplayGameStatistics`, for displaying the game/match statistics relies on variables that are incremented elsewhere inside of the code to keep track of the game statistics. I learned the importance of maintaining accurate counters and updating them at the appropriate points in the game loop.

2. I also learned more about how to properly calculate statistics when programming. For example, in my program I calculated the average time per game by dividing the total time played by the number of games(won, lost, and drawn).


## *Struggles*
1. One of the challenges I faced with this task was making sure the statistics for my `DisplayGameStatistics` method were displayed correctly. Since the `DisplayGameStatistics` method is only responsilbe for displaying the statisics and not updating the actual counters themselves, I had to be very mindful of the working relation between my `PlayGame` method, where the counters are updated, and my `DisplayGameStatistics` method, where the counter statistics are displayed.
