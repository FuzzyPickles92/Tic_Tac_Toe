## *Lessons Learned*
1. User Interface Design - I learned how to make my UI more simple, clear, and easy to understand.
2. I learned the importance of modular programming. I found that breaking my code into smaller methods made my program more legible and easy to maintain.
3. I learned how to create and use simple AI algorithms. For example, I created a simple algorithm for my computer opponent that can respond to different game states and make decisions.


## *Struggles*
1. I struggled with control flow at times when making this program. I found handling different game states and user choices to be challenging at times.
2. I also found designing certain game logic like, determining the computer's play to be a challenge.

26.Resolved - Player symbols appear on the board after the player selects a number on the board. The numbers are simply a reference for the play where they are placing their X or O symbol.
