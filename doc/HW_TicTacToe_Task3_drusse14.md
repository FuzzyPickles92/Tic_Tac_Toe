## *Lessons Learned*
1. I learned that handling user input is an important aspect of a game's run cycle because it directly affects the players/users experience and interaction with the game.
2. The importance of having a modular design to your program so that the code within it is easier to understand, maintain, and extend.
3. I learned why implementing a game loop is important for updating the game state and redrawing the game board after each move the user or AI makes.


## *Struggles*
1. My current scaling for the gameboard is 3x3. I struggle to find a solution to make the gameboard bigger because when I do, I encounter performance issues.
2. Trying to find a way to make my computer's AI more complex. Currently it only chooses the cell to the right of what ever the player selects. With further research I should be able to accomplish this goal.


## *Bugs*
### *Reported(Issues)*
1. Code Repitition - Consolidate all your Console.WriteLine calls into a single method.
2. Run-Cycle: Premature Exit - There is no way for the User to prematurely Exit the game before the end of it.
3. User Selection - Symbol - User is unable to select their Symbol.
4. Player - Mode - Currently the Game is Player vs. System. Transition the logic into a Player vs Computer, instead of Player vs Player.
5. Abstraction - Separation of Concerns - Look at your implementation and look to Abstract Logic into Classes. Use the Separation of Concerns principle to guide you.
6. Resource Management - Duplicate - You need to clean you code of duplicate assignment operations. 
7. Run-Cycle: End-Game - Currently after filling all 9 squares with a symbol, the game does not offer the ability to start a new game or exit.
